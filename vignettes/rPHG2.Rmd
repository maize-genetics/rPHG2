```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.path = "figure/graphics-",
  cache.path = "cache/graphics-",
  fig.align = "center",
  external = TRUE,
  echo = TRUE,
  warning = FALSE
)

library(rPHG2)
```

The basic workflow of the `rPHG2` package is as follows:

1.  Create a connection object
2.  Read data into the R environment
3.  Analyze and visualize data retrieval

This document introduces you to `rPHG2`'s methods and grammar, and
shows you how to apply them to the previously mentioned workflow.

## Creating connection objects

PHG databases can be connected through two primary sources:

-   local
-   server

_Local_ connections are for local TileDB instances or direct locations of 
[hVCF](https://github.com/maize-genetics/phg_v2/blob/main/docs/hvcf_specifications.md)
files on a local disk.

Conversely, _server_ locations are for databases served on publicly available
web services leveraging the [Breeding API (BrAPI) endpoints](https://brapi.org/).
